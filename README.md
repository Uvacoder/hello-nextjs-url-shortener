# Next.js Url Shortener

This accompanies the blog post on my website ["Next.js Shortened URL Automation"](https://blog.dennisokeeffe.com/blog/2021-11-04-nextjs-shortened-url-automation)

## Getting Started

```s
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

See the file `public/urls.json` to find what the shortened URL hash is.
